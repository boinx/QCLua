This Quartz Composer plug-in provides a LUA script interpreter.

This plugin was developed for BoinxTV. The purpose was the that the previously used JavaScript plug-in had a very high memory footprint. LUA drastically reduced the memory footprint. The plug-in can be used in any composition.

The plug-in is designed not to use any private (Quartz Composer) API. So the plug-in can be bundled with an app that is shipped through the Apple App Store.
