This Quartz Composer plug-in provides a LUA script interpreter.

This plugin was developed for mimoLive (formerly known as BoinxTV). The purpose was the that the previously used JavaScript plug-in had a very high memory footprint. LUA drastically reduced the memory footprint. The plug-in can be used in any composition.

The plug-in is designed not to use any private (Quartz Composer) API. So the plug-in can be bundled with an app that is shipped through the Apple App Store.

Install the plug-in to ~/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins/ or /Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins/ to make the patch available for all users on the computer. Starting with 10.7 this ~/Library folder is hidden. Use the Finder, select Go ⇢ Go to Folder … (⇧⌘G) and type in ~/Library to go to the folder.
